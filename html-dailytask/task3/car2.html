			In late 1957, Ferrari developed a new open-top 250 GT for North America. A stylish thoroughbred that was equally at home on road and track, the California Spider featured a racy, swept-back windscreen, minimal interior appointments, bucket seats, and a lightweight folding top.
			There are two main variants distinguished by the LWB (Long Wheelbase) and SWB (Short Wheelbase) nomenclature. In total, 108 were built. Fifty of the LWB California Spiders were constructed between 1957 and 1960, powered by a 2,953 cc Colombo V-12 engine producing 237 horsepower.
