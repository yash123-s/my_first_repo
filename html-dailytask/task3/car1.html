			This 1994 McLaren LM-Spec F1 is one of only two built to Le Mans specifications, meaning it’s an actual race car, with an unrestricted 680-horsepower V-12.
			When asked to build the perfect production sports car in the early 1990s, one without any compromises, McLaren turned to its revered car designer Gordon Murray. He created the F1. Limited to just 106 examples between 1994 and 1997, only 64 of which were road-legal, it is not only one of the most celebrated modern supercars but one of the rarest as well.
			“The McLaren F1 is the ultimate supercar and has long been regarded as the benchmark by which all others are compared,” RM Sotheby’s Car Specialist Alexander Weaver said in a statement.
			This specific model was delivered new to Japan in 1994 and later upgraded in two phases. It was outfitted with an unrestricted 680-horsepower GTR racing engine in 2000 and a High-Downforce Kit in 2001, which saw the nose of the car revised and the addition of front-fender vents and an enormous rear wing.
			The car is finished in platinum silver and features a cream leather interior.
