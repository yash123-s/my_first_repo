			Back in the 1950s, Aston Martin was a dominant force in racing, and many consider the DB3S Works as its pinnacle. Collectors prize the DB3S not only for their record on the track but also their beauty and drivability as road cars.
			This beauty is the second of only three DB3Ss factory-prepped for Le Mans and one of ten that raced under the factory flag at Le Mans, Sebring, Buenos Aires, Spa, and in the famed Mille Miglia. Its biggest win came at the Goodwood 9-Hour in 1953.
			The car was also owned and driven by famed racer Peter Collins, and is one of the few race cars from the 1950s that has the same chassis, body, and engine as when it left the factory.
