			This 1939 Type 64 is one of three race cars commissioned by the Nazi government and built by legendary carmaker Ferdinand Porsche for a race between Berlin and Rome— right through the heart of fascist Europe—that never occurred.
			Based on the Volkswagen Type 1 “People’s Car” (which eventually became famous as the VW Beetle), the Type 64 is widely regarded as Porsche’s first car and the precursor to the 1948 Porsche 356, the company’s first true production vehicle.
			Considered revolutionary for its time, the tiny car was designed under the guidance of Erwin Komenda— who would, a decade later, design the turtle-shaped 356. Its curvaceous body is made from thin sheets of hand-formed, aircraft-grade aluminum. In addition to looking fabulous, its aerodynamics are spectacular, allowing the car to maintain speeds of well over 80 mph even though it is equipped with a rather anemic air-cooled Volkswagen four-cylinder engine, which is estimated to make 40 horsepower.
			If all goes as planned, the Type 64 will become the most valuable Porsche ever sold at auction, eclipsing the record set by a 1970 Porsche 917K race car auctioned for $14 million in 2017 by Gooding & Company.
