					<p>The University of Mysore is a public state university in Mysore, Karnataka, India. The university was founded during the reign of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, the Maharaja of Mysore. It opened on 27 July 1916. Its first chancellor was the Maharaja of Mysore; the first Vice-Chancellor was H. V. Nanjundaiah. The university became the first outside the British administration in India, the sixth in India as a whole, and the first in Karnataka. It is a state university of the affiliating type, and became autonomous on 3 March 1956, when it gained recognition from the University Grants Commission.[2]

					The university encompasses 180 affiliated colleges and four constituent colleges (forming an aggregate of 60,000 students). In addition, the university has 37 postgraduate departments, eight specialised research and training centres, and two postgraduate centres that together offer a total of about 55 regular academic programs to 3,500 students. It also runs a number of employment-oriented diploma courses and certificate programs.

					The Mysore University Library comprises over 800,000 books, 2,400 journal titles, and 100,000 volumes of journals. The main campus features an amphitheater, an auditorium, a swimming pool, and hostel accommodations for men and women. As of July 2013, the University of Mysore was accredited "Grade A" by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).[3]
					Mysore University has a dedicated Prasaranga, in the lines of Oxford University Press, formally established by Dr.Kuvempu on 6'th July 1960.
					The University of Mysore is the 6th oldest university in India and the oldest in the state of Karnataka. It was established in 1916 by then Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, after two of his educational experts (C. R. Reddy and Thomas Denham) undertook a five-year study of higher education around the world. They structured the new school to encompass elements from universities that promote original research (University of Chicago), those that emphasise extending knowledge among the people (University of Wisconsin), and those that combine intellectualism with an educational system calculated to train students for political and social life (University of Oxford and Cambridge). H. V. Nanjundaiah, who played a key role in establishing the university, was elected by the Maharaja of Mysore to run the University as the first Vice-Chancellor, and he held the post until his death in 1920. Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, then Dewan of Mysore, also played a major role in its promotion. The university was inaugurated on 27 July 1916. Maharaja College of Mysore and the Central College of Bangalore, both previously affiliated with Madras University, became part of the new university. The Act was amended in 1933 and 1939 to make the senate representative of public life and to establish the academic council responsible for the academic affairs of the university.

					During the reorganisation of Mysore state in 1956, the Mysore University Act passed, which made the university an autonomous body (this has since been superseded by the Karnataka State Universities Act, 2000). In 1960, the university's graduate centre was set up in the picturesque environs of Kukkarahalli lake. The national poet and Jnanpith Award winner, K. V. Puttappa (Kuvempu), a former Vice-Chancellor of the University, christened this campus 'Manasagangotri', meaning: 'the fountainhead of the Ganges of the Mind' or 'the eternal spring of the mind'. Bangalore University was carved out in 1964 starting with Central College, Bangalore, and the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering. Mangalore University was formed out of the colleges in Dakshina Kannada in 1980.</td></p>
