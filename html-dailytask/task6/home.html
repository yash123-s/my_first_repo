			The university has recently changed academic direction, with a greater emphasis on basic science. It has introduced integrated MSc courses in physics, chemistry, and biochemistry. The University has also formed ties with various Chinese universities for resource sharing and training in information technology education.

 			The International School of Information Management, was created in 2005 through the collaboration of three US universities, as well as Dalhousie University of Canada, and IIIT, Bangalore.[7] Faculty members from these partnering institutions teach at ISiM.

			The Third Sector Research Resource Centre (TSRRS) was established in 2004. The aim of the centre is '...to undertake and promote interdesciplinary [sic] studies and research in the domain of civil society,'[8] with a secondary aim of developing and offering Diploma and Masters programs in the management of non-profit organisations.[9]

			More recently, the Department of Law in the university was incorporated into the Mysore University School of Justice (MUSJ). Continuing with the university's initiative to introduce five-year integrated courses to produce professionals with in-depth knowledge, the MUSJ has introduced a program leading to a degree in law,[10] as a bid to enhance the quality of legal education in Karnataka.

			Other initiatives currently underway by the University are the establishment of a National Centre for History of Science, a digital library, a Centre for International Programmes, a school of life sciences, an IT division, and a joint campus with IIS-Bangalore. In the last five years, an Archaeological and Folklore Museum has been established in the Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion with a donation from the Infosys Foundation.
