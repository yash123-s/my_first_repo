				Pet adoption is the process of taking responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or released to a shelter or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters and rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care.
				There are many unknown benefits of rescuing a dog that many people are not aware of. A lot of these benefits are not specific to dogs, but overall dogs are one of the most popular animals to have as a pet. (1)[19] Rescuing versus adopting from a pet store can save money. Besides the fact that the physical puppy or dog will be cheaper than if purchased at a pet store, shelters often microchip, spay, neuter, and vaccinate[20] the animals that they are taking care of. Therefore, one can save up to $300 by already adopting a neutered or spayed dog. (2) Rescuing will help eliminate puppy farms. Despite the fact that puppy farms are illegal, many people throughout the world still benefit from the profits made. A lot of the problem comes from the fact that people are not even aware of the fact that they are adopting a puppy that was bred from a puppy farm. That is why it is vital to research on exactly where one is adopting from before purchasing a puppy. (3) Owning a dog can benefit one's own health and wellbeing. Multiple studies have shown that not only can having a dog improve one's happiness and health, but it can also elongate one's life. Specifically, service dogs help with depression, stress, and anxiety. Playing with a dog daily is proven to increase levels of serotonin and dopamine, two chemicals naturally produced in the human body that make one feel happy and play important roles in brain and body function. (4) Parents that have dogs provide life lessons and extended benefits to their children. Not only does having a dog naturally teach children responsibilities, but it can also help them with separation anxiety and feeling a sense of security when they are at home. (5) Dogs will always provide unconditional love. Regardless of what may have happened minutes, hours, or days before, a dog will love you and will always be there, greeting with as much love and kindness as if nothing had ever gone wrong.
